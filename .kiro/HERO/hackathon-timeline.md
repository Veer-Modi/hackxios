## The Kiro Difference: 90 Minutes of Planning = 24 Hours of Execution

**Without Kiro:**
- Hours 0-8: Requirements gathering and architecture debates
- Hours 8-16: Basic timer implementation with bugs
- Hours 16-24: Frantic debugging and incomplete features

**With Kiro:**
- Hours 0-1: Setup (no planning needed)
- Hours 1-12: Systematic feature implementation
- Hours 12-24: Polish, advanced features, and deployment

**Result:** A hackathon-winning app that could immediately compete in the productivity market, built by following Kiro's systematic plan rather than improvising under pressure.

This timeline demonstrates how upfront AI-assisted planning transforms hackathon chaos into predictable execution, enabling teams to build production-quality systems under extreme time constraints.
