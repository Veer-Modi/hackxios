# 🎯 AI Study Buddy - Project Idea

## 📖 Overview
A web app that helps you study better using a timer and game-like features.

## 🔧 How It Works

### Core Mechanics
- **🍅 Study Timer (Pomodoro)** - You set a 25-minute timer to study
- **👀 Stay Focused Rule** - You must stay on the study app tab
- **❤️ Life System** - Like a video game, you have 5 "lives" each day
- **⚠️ Penalty** - Switch tabs = lose 1 life + timer pauses
- **🚫 Game Over** - 0 lives = no more studying until tomorrow
- **🏆 Competition** - See who studies the most and stays focused
- **🔥 Streaks** - Build daily study habits and perfect focus records

## 💡 Why It's Helpful

✅ **Makes studying feel like a game**  
✅ **Stops you from getting distracted by social media**  
✅ **Builds good study habits through daily practice**  
✅ **Motivates you to compete with friends**
